        <p class="rec-text">While designing my Wordpress E-Commerce website, I had to initially think of something to create which would be something that I can relate to. That thinking process came to the idea of creating a tech-themed shop which encorporates computer parts and accessories for sale, along with various other tech related products. I also thought of colour palettes that would be accesible to people that may require it and be readible.</p>
	    <p class="rec-text">To create my navigation, I had to think of something that would be very easy to navigate through. This was done by considering Primary and Secondary navigation types and Footer Navigation. In my Primary navigation, I thought about what sublinks a viewer may want to redirect themselves into, which is why I made those the ones that are visible on the header. The rest I nested as a dropdown menu, also known as the Secondary navigation type as those links fell directly underneath one of the Primary links. The footer was used to give detail on specific items that would make sense for a store, and has some links built-in to it as well so that the viewer is easily able to find certain pages without having to always navigate through the primary and secondary navigation.</p>

    <div class="column">
      <p class="rec-text">After figuring out the theme of my site, I had to think of adding different media components and design elements that would catch the viewers attention and make them scroll down to find more information regarding products. This was done by implementing a muted looping video of a PC with flashing colours, which connected to the DIY page and shop, showing what could be purchased and built.</p>
	  <p class="rec-text">Various other elements were also included within the design of the homepage, such as including a carousel of certain products that may be of value to customers, and including a blog post section which informs viewers of promotions and sales that may be valid or coming soon.</p>

    <div class="column">
		<p class="rec-text">For the shop, this was using a plugin on Wordpress that allowed to create an E-Commerce site and included a cart page as well. this page was designed to show products of various categories which can be found within tags of the products. A design element that was considered within the designing process of this page was to use a grid that contain a row of 4 products as this would allow for more products to be visible, but also to not be crowded. The design was changed due to CSS as well. This can be seen within the fonts, colours, and buttons within the entirety of the shop, including singular product pages.</p>

    <div class="column">
      <p class="rec-text">Within my store, I wanted to make a section that could be informative to viewers that may be trying to build a PC of their own. I designed a wireframe which I thought would be useful for this type of site as I knew images were going to be required to make the information be useful as without visualizations there would be no proper method to explain what is being described to someone that has no idea of building a PC.</p>
	  <p class="rec-text">Going from the wireframe to the high fidelity design, I realized that it would make more sense to have images be in different places so that the website has a better flow and is not mixing viewers up between sections.</p>

		<p class="rec-text">In the About page, I knew from the start that it was going to be the place where viewers would go if they required details on what the brand is based on, how it came to be, and various other information such as the address, store timings, contact information, and shipping details.</p>
		<p class="rec-text">When creating the high fidelity design of the page, I had a rough idea of what I wanted to design, based off the wireframe. I thought about making the page as useful as possible and my initial thought was to give details of the brand first but later realized this may not be as important of a feature like a map and contact information would be, thus redesigning the ordering of the page.</p>

		<p class="rec-text">The contact page within the 1Stop website was designed to be very user friendly. This being a contact page, there was no reason to make it absolutely detailed where the attention of the viewer was brought else where, as there must have been a reason for them to go to the contact page. This was overall designed using the same colours and fonts that were used throughout the website, and a disclaimer of wait times for a response.</p>
