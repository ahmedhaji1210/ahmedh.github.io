      <div class="column">
        <p class="process-text">While designing my portfolio website, I wanted to use elements that would make my website be visually appealing, but also not be something that would hurt the viewers' eyes. To initially create my design, I knew I wanted to make my pages have some sort of margining occur on the right and left sides. I did this and made the enitre margin and header and custom blue colour which I used the <a class="process-text" href="webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker">WebAIM Contrast Checker</a> for to pick a colour that would contrast well for readibility.</p>
		<p class="process-text">Furthermore, I looked into what I could do to make my website pop and realized that black text and thus and black footer would match well together, and with a black background, a white foreground goes perfect, which is why I made the footer text white. I further took this into my button design as I made the buttons follow the colour scheme of my website, and then the hover would make it black with white text to create contrast.</p>
      </div>

	  <hr>
	  <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <p class="process-text">To make my homepage be visually appealing and eyecatching, I made a typing text input within the landing page, which animates every time the page refreshes. I also wanted to give this a bit of a twist and included a fading "Email Me" button, which is also responsive. This was all created within a parallax as well to make the website feel smooth and give it a sense of completeness rather than being plain and boring.</p>

		<img src="../images/hp-carousel.png" alt="Image of homepage carousel" style="width: 90%;">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
		<p class="process-text">Making my website even more interactive on the homepage, I thought of how I could use the parallax to my benefit and make it more appealing than to be just images. At first I wanted my landing page to have a carousel be the first thing that showed up, but it looked out of place. I then decided that the better idea would be to go with the route I went with, and then having the addition of a carousel within the parallax.</p>

	  <hr>
	  <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <p class="process-text">In my Projects page, I wanted this page to be something that was very interactive, which would tie in with one of the Micro Conversions within my site. I designed it this way on purpose because it allows for the viewer to take glance at a variety of my work and in this case, see the differences in level of creativeness and advancement when designing websites, as well as other skills that are outside of digitalized development.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="column">
		<p class="process-text">I introduced a modal system in this page because it felt fitting as it made the specific image the main point of view that the viewer has clicked on. This modal allows for a carousel to be displayed so that the viewer can scroll through images using the right and left chevron buttons, as well as have a caption displayed if they are a view greater than 600px.</p>
      </div>	
 	  </div>
	  <hr>
	  <div class="row">
	  <p class="process-text" style="text-align: center">Looking into my "<a href="../html/resume.html">Resume</a>" page and "<a href="recent.html">Recent Work</a>," I made these pages look professional rather than going overboard with the designing in them as they are meant to be more informative and detailed rather than interactive. However, within the Recent Work page, there are multiple buttons that redirect the user to a static link of my CCT460 Assignment 1 Wordpress website, along with a column and row breakdown to help display specific sections, and another button that opens the resume in the Resume page.</p>

	  <hr>
	  <div class="row">
		<h3 class="process-h3">Process, Web Analytics Program & SEO/SEM Keyword Plan</h3>
		<p class="process-text">When designing my pages, I knew that I would need certain keywords to help plan the Search Engine Optimization on my website. This was done by using keywords such as "Protfolio," "Design," "Project," "Web Development," etc., page titles, and decriptions to help with the website being higher within the top results if the website was to be on a live link. I also made sure to use various tags and names that would make sense within the styling of the website as that would result in the site to be much more optimized, rather than having random tags and classes being thrown all along the site.</p>
		<p class="process-text">Considering the Macro and Micro conversion goals and rates of my website, using Google Analytics, this would all be possible as the website could be tracked in real-time to see where a viewer has logged in from and what they are doing on the site. If there is any sort of monetization on the site, this would help explore that, but for this case since it is not, the benefits from looking at Macro conversions would be if a viewer completes the contact form and submits it (which is unresponsive for the assignment) and the Micro conversions would come from the viewer navigating through the site and engagement and interacting with the modals, buttons, etc.</p>
		<p class="process-text">Some user and system segmentation that are unique to my portfolio website are that it can be used as a template for web developers to see how bootstrap is implemented with code that has been crated and borrowed from other sources to create a responsive website that is user friendly and will work on mobile devices as well. Another unique aspect to it would be that keywords can be explored to see what kind of placcement search engines puts the website on and if the SEO within the code is actually helping to benefit the ranking of the site. One other segmentation would be that this website could be appealing to potential contactors as that is the main goal of the website, such that people contact me for possible work placement, etc.</p>
